  <p>Live Catalogue is a tool for communicating and networking within the community. It provides information selected by experts that may be of interest to the community, covering areas such as projects, training, reports, requests for collaboration, tenders, open calls, contracts, support documents, articles and news.</p>
  <p>Live Catalogue is not a discussion forum but does provide a basis for the NRC FLIS community to select topics for further co-operation, examination and work.</p>
